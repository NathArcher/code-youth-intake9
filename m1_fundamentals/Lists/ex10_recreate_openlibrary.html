Open Library offers a suite of APIs to help developers get up and running with our data. This includes <a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/restful_api">RESTful APIs</a>, which make Open Library data availabile in JSON, YAML and RDF/XML formats. There's also an earlier, now deprecated  <a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/json_api">JSON API</a> which is preserved for backward compatibility.
<br><br><ul style="font-size: medium;">
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books"><b>Books</b></a> API - Retrieve a specific work or edition by identifier</li><br>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/authors"><b>Authors</b></a> API - Retrieve an author and their works by author identifier</li><br>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/subjects"><b>Subjects</b></a>   API - Fetch books by subject name</li><br>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search"><b>Search</b></a> API - Search results for books, authors, and more</li><br>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search_inside"><b>Search inside</b></a> API - Search for matching text within millions of books</li><br>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/read"><b>Partner</b></a>API - Formerly the "Read" API, fetch one or more books by library identifiers (ISBNs, OCLC, LCCNs)</li><br>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers"><b>Covers</b></a> API - Fetch book covers by ISBN or Open Library identifier</li><br>
<li><a href="https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/recentchanges"><b>Recent Changes</b></a> API - Programatic access to changes across Open Library</li><br>
</ul>
<h4 style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119);">Bulk Access</h4>
<b>Please do not use our APIs for bulk download</b> of Open Library data because this affects our ability to serve patrons. We make our data <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps">publicly available</a> each month for partners. If you want a dump of complete data, please read about your <a href="https://openlibrary.org/data#downloads">Bulk Download</a> options, or email us at <a href="mailto:openlibrary@archive.org">openlibrary@archive.org.</a><br>

<h4 style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119);">APIs</h4>
Did you know, nearly every page on Open Library is or has an API. You can return structured bibliographic data for any page by adding a .rdf/.json/.yml extension to the end of any Open Library identifier. For instance: <a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15626917W.json">https://openlibrary.org/works/OL15626917W.json</a>  or <a href="https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL33421A.json.">https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL33421A.json.</a>  Many pages, such as the Books, Authors, and Lists, will include links to their RDF and JSON formats.<br>

<h4 style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119);">Questions</h4>
We encourage developers to ask questions by opening issues on  <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues">GitHub</a> and on our  <a href="https://gitter.im/theopenlibrary/Lobby">gitter</a> chat channel.<br><br>



<h4 style="color: rgb(119, 119, 119);">Friends using Open Library APIs</h4>
Several developers are creating amazing things with the Open Library APIs: <br>
<ul style="font-size: large;">
<li><a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/"><b>Trove</b></a> by the <i>National Library of Australia</i><br>
Trove is a new discovery experience focused on Australia and Australians. It supplements what search engines provide with reliable information from Australia's memory institutions. The system hits Open Library when public domain books turn up in searches, and displays links to Open Library.</li><br>
 
<li><a href="https://koha-community.org/"><b>Koha</b></a><br>
Koha is an open source library system for public libraries that includes catalog searches and member organizing. It uses Open Library covers, displays OL related subjects, and lendable eBooks using the Read API.</li><br>
 
<li><a href="https://evergreen-ils.org/"><b>Evergreen</b></a><br>
Evergreen is highly-scalable software for libraries that helps library patrons find library materials, and helps libraries manage, catalog, and circulate those materials. It uses Open Library for covers, tables of contents, with plans to expand into other areas.</li><br>
 
<li><a href="https://read.gov/books/"><b>read.gov</b></a> by the <i>Library of Congress</i><br>
OK, this isn't exactly Open Library, but it's still awesome! The Library of Congress have modified the Internet Archive's Book Reader to sit perfectly within their Rare Books Collection site.</li><br>
 
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/openbook4wordpress/"><b>OpenBook WordPress Plug-in</b></a> by <i>John Miedema</i><br>
OpenBook is useful for anyone who wants to add book covers and other book data on a WordPress website. OpenBook links to detailed book information in Open Library, the main data source, as well as other book sites. Users have complete control over the display through templates. OpenBook can link to library records by configuring an OpenURL resolver or through a WorldCat link. OpenBook inserts COinS so that other applications like Zotero can pick up the book data.</li><br>
 
<li><a href="https://wiki.code4lib.org/Umlaut"><b>Umlaut</b></a> by <i>Jason Ronallo</i><br>
Umlaut is a middle-tier OpenURL link resolver that adds functions and services to commercial link resolving software.</li><br>
 
<li><a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2009/virtual-shelf"><b>Virtual Shelf</b></a> by <i>Jonathan Breitbart and Devin Blong</i> (UC Berkeley School of Information)<br>
The Virtual Shelf is a visualization created by two students at the UC Berkeley School of Information. The project includes the student's master thesis, with research into the searching and browsing patterns of library patrons. The Open Library RESTful API was utilized during the project as a source of metadata for the user interface.</li><br>
 
<li><a href=""><b>RDC UI Toolkit</b></a> by <i>Rural Design Collective</i><br>
This group created a suite of tools that facilitates the creation of localized user interfaces for public domain books. The RDC used the Open Library Covers API and the Internet Archive Book Reader in their online demonstration customized for the OLPC XO.</li><br>
